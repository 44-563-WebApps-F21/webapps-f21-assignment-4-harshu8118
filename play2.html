            that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only

        You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don’t like compliments, and I
        don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when
        he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.</p>

        <p class = "speech">I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to
            quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that.
            But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men
            are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes
            think you pretend to be worse.</p>
