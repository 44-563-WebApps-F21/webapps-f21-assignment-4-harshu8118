        <p class = "speech">Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up,
            that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only
            things we _can_ pay.</p>  
        <h6 class ="name WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>
        <p class = "stage-direction">[_Shaking her head_.]</p>
        <p class = "speech">No, I am talking very seriously.
        You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don’t like compliments, and I
        don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when
        he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.</p>
        <h6 class ="name DARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6> 
        <p class = "speech">Ah, but I did mean them.</p>
        <p class = "stage-direction">[_Takes tea which she offers him_.]</p>

        <p class = "stage-direction">[_Gravely_.]</p>
        <p class = "speech">I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to
            quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that.
            But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men
            are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes
            think you pretend to be worse.</p>

        <p class = "speech">We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.</p>
