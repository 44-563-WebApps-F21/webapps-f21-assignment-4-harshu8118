                <p>[LADY WINDERMERE _is at table R._, _arranging roses in a blue bowl_.]<br></p>

                <p>[_Enter_ PARKER.]<br></p>

                <h6>PARKER.</h6>
                <p>Is your ladyship at home this afternoon?<br></p>

                <h6> WINDERMERE. </h6> 
                <p>Yes—who has called?<br> </p>

                <h6>PARKER.</h6>  
                <p>Lord Darlington, my lady.<br></p>

                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> 
                <p>[_Hesitates for a moment_.] <br></p>
                <p>Show him up—and I’m at home to any one who calls.<br></p>

                <h6>PARKER.</h6> 
                <p> Yes, my lady.<br></p>

                                                                    <p>[_Exit C._]</p> 

                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  
                <p>It’s best for me to see him before to-night.  I’m glad he’s come.</p><br>

                <p>[_Enter_ PARKER _C._]</p>

                <h6>PARKER.</h6>  
                <p>Lord Darlington,</p><br>

                <p>[_Enter_ LORD DARLINGTON _C._]</p>

                                                                            <p>[_Exit_ PARKER.]</p>

                <h6>LORD DARLINGTON.</h6> 
                <p>How do you do, Lady Windermere?</p><br>

                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> 
                <p> How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
                    hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
                    lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.</p><br>

                <h6>LORD DARLINGTON.</h6> 
                <p>They are quite perfect.</p><br>
                 <p>[_Sees a fan lying on the table_.]</p>  
                 <p>And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?</p><br>

                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> 
                <p> Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
                    everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
                    present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?</p><br>

                <h6>LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  
                <p>?  Is it really?</p><br>

                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> 
                 <p>Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
                    life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
                    down.</p>
                 <p>[_Still arranging flowers_.]</p>

                <h6>LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>
                <p> [_Sitting down_.]</p>  
                <p>[I wish I had known it was your
                    birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in
                    front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for
                    you.</p><br>

                                                                           <p> [_A short pause_.]</p>

                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> 
                <p>Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the
                     Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.</p><br>

                <h6>LORD DARLINGTON. </h6>
                <p> I, Lady Windermere?</p><br>

                <p>[_Enter_ PARKER _and_ FOOTMAN _C._, _with tray and tea things_.]</p>

                <h6>LADY WINDERMER</h6>
                <p> Put it there, Parker.  That will do.  [_Wipes her hands
                    with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]
                    Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?</p> <br>

                                                                        <p>[_Exit_ PARKER _C._]</p> 

                <h6>LORD DARLINGTON. </h6>
                 <p>[_Takes chair and goes across L.C._] </p> 
                 <p>I am quite miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did. </p> <br>
                 <p>[_Sits down at table L._]</p>

                <h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>
                <p> Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the  whole evening.</p>

                    
            </p>
