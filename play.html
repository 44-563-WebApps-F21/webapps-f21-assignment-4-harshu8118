                PARKER.  Is your ladyship at home this afternoon?<br>

                LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes—who has called?<br>
                
                PARKER.  Lord Darlington, my lady.<br>
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Hesitates for a moment_.]  Show him up—and I’m at
                home to any one who calls.<br>
                
                PARKER.  Yes, my lady.<br>
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  It’s best for me to see him before to-night.  I’m glad
                he’s come.<br>
                
                PARKER.  Lord Darlington,<br>
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  How do you do, Lady Windermere?<br>
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
                hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
                lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.<br>
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  They are quite perfect.  [_Sees a fan lying on the
                table_.]  And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?<br>
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
                everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
                present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?<br>
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  No?  Is it really?<br>
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
                life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
                down.  [_Still arranging flowers_.]<br>
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  I wish I had known it was your
                birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in
                front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for
                you.<br>
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the
                Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.<br>
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  I, Lady Windermere?<br>
                
                [_Enter_ PARKER _and_ FOOTMAN _C._, _with tray and tea things_.]<br>
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Put it there, Parker.  That will do.  [_Wipes her hands
                with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]
                Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?<br>
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]  I am quite
                miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.  [_Sits down at
                table L._]<br>
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Still seated L.C._]  Oh, nowadays so many conceited
                people go about Society pretending to be good, that I think it shows
                rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad.  Besides,
                there is this to be said.  If you pretend to be good, the world takes you
                very seriously.  If you pretend to be bad, it doesn’t.  Such is the
                astounding stupidity of optimism.<br>

                LADY WINDERMERE.  Don’t you _want_ the world to take you seriously then,
                Lord Darlington?<br>

                LORD DARLINGTON.  No, not the world.  Who are the people the world takes
                seriously?  All the dull people one can think of, from the Bishops down
                to the bores.  I should like _you_ to take me very seriously, Lady
                Windermere, _you_ more than any one else in life.<br>

                LADY WINDERMERE.  Why—why me?
